2007 Honda City i-DSI,Aoa I bought this car in August 2020. I switched from Mehran. After spending 6 months with this car I must say it's a great car and it gives you best mileage depending on your foot. Almost same maintenance like Mehran. There is only one fault in it that is its breaking capacity is not up to the mark. Otherwise it can achieve more than 170 on the m2 at 4800 rpm. Great Ac. 
2015 Honda City,Very poor built quality in comparison of it's price tag you can get a used & old Japanese car insted of a brand new Honda city as many of the Japanese cars have features from the future Era.Japnese engineer's build there cars for future comparison & these cars are way more reliable than the one being fakely manufactured in Pakistan n having a huge price tag.
2007 Honda City i-DSI,"I had this car as the first owner, very good car, it was a perfect sedan, it's better than the pakistani corolla, and it has alot of good qualities, i never changed its tires and it didn't had a tire problem, i changed nothing and left it as a company, now I sold it and i am still missing it, great car for you."
2009 Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC Prosmatec,Good car but style is old and fuel economy is ok. But resell value for auto version is awsome. Why demand is increased suddenly i dont know. Auto car demand is so high as compared to supply that prices for old model 2009 has been at its peak. However as far as i know new shape of city is round the corner and i am expecting that after its lauching demand for old model will decline.
2004 Honda City i-DSI,"I had this car for 5 years. Its great value for money for people who want to buy car around 10 lac. Exterior design is 90s fashioned but has much better aerodynamics as compared to many other cars like Toyota Corolla and other cars available in this price tag. Interior space is good for people under 6 feet 3 inch. It comes with standard AC/Heater, most people have replaced standard cd player with the DVD touch screen with 4 speakers. Comfort level is also high."
2017 Honda City 1.3 i-VTEC Prosmatec,"Honda City has its own pros and cons. Personally, I am not impressed by the built quality of this car. I have kept it with immense care but still after 3 years and approx 70k milleage, there is a strange noise which can be heard from the engine while the car is accelerated. Even Honda itself is not able to determine this issue. Apart from this the dashboard of the car is loosing its paint gradually and it seems like the dashboard's original color was beige and the company spray painted the dashboard black. The performance and response of the engine is fine. But still even the top of the line aspire variant has no airbags and basic features such as traction control, automatic climate control, hill start assist, steering switches. I personally will not recommend this car to anyone as it priced approx 30 lacs."
2019 Honda City 1.5 i-VTEC Prosmatec,Although city is good car and value for money but its fuel average is disturbing it gives 7-8 in city on average foot and 12-14 on long if under 120 but it gives amazing performance amazing pickup and power of car gives you joy this car is for those who don't care about fuel average. My experience with city is too old had the same model in 2017 and got another one same model same specs in 2019 satisfied by its performance. It goes to 160-170 easily without any problem. Perfect car but fuel average is not so good.
